History of Public Transportation
Public transportation has evolved significantly since ancient times, with early examples including Roman chariots and Chinese rickshaws. The 19th century saw the rise of horse-drawn carriages and steam-powered trains, revolutionizing urban mobility. The invention of the electric tram in the 1880s and the first subway system in 1863 marked major milestones. Throughout the 20th century, buses and highways expanded networks, while recent decades focus on sustainability and智能化. Today, innovations like electric buses and ride-sharing apps continue to reshape the field.
