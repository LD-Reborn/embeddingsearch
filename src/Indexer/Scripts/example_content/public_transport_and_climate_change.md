Public Transport and Climate Change
Expanding public transportation is a key strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Transit systems powered by renewable energy can achieve near-zero carbon footprints. Electrification of buses and trains accelerates decarbonization efforts. Cities with robust transit networks experience lower per capita emissions compared to car-dependent regions. International agreements increasingly emphasize public transit as a climate action priority.
