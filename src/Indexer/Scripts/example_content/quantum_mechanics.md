Quantum Mechanics
Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. It introduces principles like wave-particle duality, superposition, and quantum entanglement, which defy classical intuition. The Schr√∂dinger equation governs how quantum states evolve over time. Unlike classical physics, quantum mechanics incorporates probability amplitudes and uncertainty principles. It underpins modern technologies such as semiconductors and quantum computing.
