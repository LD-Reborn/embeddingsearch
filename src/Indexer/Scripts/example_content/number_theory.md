Number Theory
Number theory explores the properties and relationships of integers, particularly primes and divisibility. It includes the study of Diophantine equations and modular arithmetic. The distribution of prime numbers remains a central mystery in mathematics. Cryptographic systems rely on number-theoretic concepts like factorization. Recent advances involve analytic and algebraic methods to solve ancient problems.
